# JumpCraft
A Minecraft Plugin that changes player physics
-----------------
The goal of this project is to add traditional 3D platformer elements (such as wall climbs, wall jumps, diving, etc...) to Minecraft.
Feel free to fork this project and add your own features to the plugin.
<br>
This plugin uses my custom-made core, so if you want to clone it and change the code send me an e-mail or friend me on Discord and I'll
give you the source code to my core (I might make it open-source in the future too).
